The second annual conference will bring forward some of the top leaders in the sports industry, provide educational opportunities for university students, and career opportunities for those looking to break into the sports world.\nOur mission statement is to democratize sports business as a content-driven conference by thought leaders seeking to redefine the industry.\nNOTE: In 2018, we had 54 speakers, 50 sessions and sold out our conference &amp; single day passes prior to the show.\nCheck back continuously to see our updated schedule and speaker list - starting in Feb. 2019, we should have our first tentative list of content and speakers announced.\n\nThe Seattle Sports Marketing Conference will have several educational tracks with some of the top speakers in the sports &amp; entertainment industry. Those tracks include:\n- Breaking/Working In Sports\n- Sports Media/PR/Journalism\n- eSports\n- Sports Law\n- Sports Sustainability/Social Responsibility\n- Sports Technology/Analytics\n- Sports Marketing/Promotions\n- Sports Sponsorship\n- Sports Sales Training\n- Sports Apparel\n- Sports Venues\n&amp; more tracks to come.\n\nThe 2019 Career Fair will have a &quot;speed dating&quot; career fair with hiring managers from professional teams/organizations around the country. It is an additional fee and participants will have 5-8 minutes per hiring manager to give their personal elevator pitch, answer interview questions, and hand over their resume for a chance to break into the sports industry. We actively seek sports employers with jobs to sit on these engagement sessions.\n\nConference Book Author &amp; Autograph Program, will provide attendees with access to select sports author readings, engage with the authors afterward as well as the ability to get their books signed at the conference. We've set it up so that you can order their books ahead of the conference, and have them delivered to the conference site, to ease the issue of leaving a book home that you wanted to get signed.\n\nNetworking Night provides the ability for young professionals to gain extra time with each other in a casual setting. The actual location(s) are TBA until we get a final head count but will be within the city limits of Seattle.\n\n1-on-1 Mentoring Sessions are set up between students and selected sports business professionals in advance of the conference. This is not just a resume a review. This is about seeking out ways to improve at the sports marketing conference and maximize the results when getting to conference.\n\nMentor's Lunch is new for 2019 are set up between students and selected sports business professionals in a round table discussion - sharing a meal together (which is included with the ticket price). You want to pick the brain of a professional, this is your opportunity to do so.\n\nFAQs\nCan you explain your ticket pricing policy?\nWe operate on a &quot;you snooze, you lose&quot; policy of ticket pricing, which is broken down for someone to buy a one day pass on either Sept. 30 or Oct. 1, or they can purchase the full conference pass for both dates. There are only a certain amount of tickets per price level, which means that once those tickets are gone, the next price available may be higher. Single day passes start at $10, a conference pass starts at $15, and they go up incrementally based on purchased demand. NOTE: It is wise to purchase your tickets early as the price will not go down or remain static once ticket inventory is all go for a specific price level. This includes add-on items such as the career fair and once inventory for networking nights, autograph alley, etc are gone, they are gone for good.\n\nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?\nThere is no minimum age, however, it is best recommended that below the age of 16, the options for sports career employment will be minimal to start.\n\nWhat are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nComplete parking information: https://www.wscc.com/directions\n\nWhat is on your menu for the conference?\nWe don't serve food as part of the conference except during the mentor's lunch which is available as an add-on price. You are on your own for eating opportunities. Luckily, the conference is in downtown Seattle, which boasts some of the best food available around it. You will not starve.\n\nWhere do I stay for the conference?\nWe don't have an established hotel... yet - but we are potentially working on it. We find that they typically create cost barriers for conference attendees. Stay where you like. There are about 30 within a mile walking distance of the Washington State Convention Center. If you want to be very affordable, it is suggested that an Airbnb or Extended Stay (i.e. lowest cost) is worth checking into.\n\nWhat can I bring into the event?\nA stack of business cards, resumes, and business attire is recommended.\n\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?\nTroy Kirby - President/CEO, 360-402-1484\n\nHow can I receive a deck to sponsor this event?\nDavid Gravenkemper - VP/Partnerships\n\nWhat's the refund policy?\nNo refunds to the conference - this makes it fair for our attendees because it is based on demand pricing. You can transfer passes if necessary if you cannot make it. All speakers promoted are scheduled to appear, however Tao of Sports, LLC cannot guarantee specific speakers/specific team executives may not cancel due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts. Tao of Sports, LLC will make every reasonable attempt to broadcast/promote any speaker lineup changes/team executive (additions/subtractions).\n", "time": "1:30 PM - 10:00 PM", "cost": "Free"}, {"link": "https://jobfairs.indeed.com/Seattle/fair/16395", "name": "Seattle Job Fair - November 4, 2019 Career Fairs", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2019", "location": "", "description": "FREE FOR ALL JOB SEEKERS!
